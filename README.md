# ToDo-List


Built a ToDo List Web App relies on Node.js that allows us to be able to add or delete new items as well as creating separate ToDo lists typing /...(whatever we want) after the adress. 


Besides, used Mongoose to persist the data in the database.

And moved the database to a server for it to be served up 24/7 by using MongoDB/Atlas.
